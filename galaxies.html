								<h3>SED synthesis and analysis</h3>
								<p style="text-align: left;">Originally envisioned as an attempt to understand trends in the different qualities of blue compact dwarf galaxies, limitations of scope and
									means quickly became apparent as time went on. As did the lack of an overaching initial question. It would have certainly been possible to find various qualities of
									galaxies and find means and deviations for them, but doing so wouldn't answer any ovarching question, rather just being an extraneous
									exercise in low level statistics.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: left;">What I came away from McDonald observatory with was a collection of images within B, V, and I Johnson-Cousins' filters and an H-alpha filter for two
									reasonably nearby dwarf galaxies, NGC 2976 and NGC 4395. Located approximately 3.5 and 4.4Mpc away, respectively, these two very distinct galaxies
									presented an opportunity to test the amount of information that could be gathered using what information I had and what I could mine from catalogues.
									Though not ideal subjects nor an ideal project to answer a particular research question, it was a deeply productive endeavor that ended up equipping
									me with a new suite of tools that going forward will continue to be refined and notably don't necessarily require additional telescope resources to
									carry out. Further, though it may not have yielded particularly high quality SED models, it did indeed produce them.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: left;">Data collection consisted of two methods. The first taking three images of each galaxy with exposure times of three minutes for each of the four filters, with this process
                                    being aided by my professor Dr. Hartigan of Rice University. 
									This data was then reduced using IRAF and several of its packages including zerocombine, flatcombine, ccdproc, imalign, and imcombine. This resulted in a set of
									four images available for further analysis. A major issue that came up in this phase was signal to noise, with NGC 4395 being a low surface brightness galaxy,
									by definition dimmer than the sky background. This led to it being the most difficult to produce high quality images of, something that can be observed in the
									remaining noise visible in some of the images seen here, but the results were nonetheless spectacular to look at and analyze. The second method of data
									collection was far less exciting, though no less important due to the small number of data points I had available, which was using the Gaia and Vizier catalogues
									to find stars with good quality magnitude information and to find magnitudes of my targets in filters that I hadn't collected.

                                <p style="text-align: left;">Once reduced, the imaging data was then transferred to Python due to difficulties experienced while using IRAF's photcal package. In this environment, SEP was used to identify
                                    objects, including a number of stars within our galaxy that happen to occupy the plane of NGC 4395, then these objects were passed to the photutils and astropy library to
                                    calculate flux ratios and ultimately find the apparent magnitudes of the galaxies. From here the difficulty curve of the analysis increased greatly, as it was necessarily
                                    to learn at least some of the Fortran programming language and manage several wrappers and environments to operate a program known as FSPS. The primary use and reason for the
                                    name FSPS is flexible stellar population synthesis, wherein inputted data is synthesized into a modelled population. This synthesized model could then be analyzed for the quality of
                                    fit to the inputted data.
								</p>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">Initial fits with this process, unless exceedingly lucky, are not likely to produce good fits and thus potentially meaningful results, however.
                                    This necessitates iteration and tweaking of the models. This role was mediated by another package named astro-Prospector, which iteratively compared
                                    the fits of the models, then used both the dynesty and emcee packages to adjust model perameters each time. Of these two, emcee with its Monte Carlo approach consistently performed
                                    better than the former, but it would be remiss to not acknowledge that both were used. A particular challenge faced here and the reason for acquiring catalogue data for both
                                    targets was that in doing this, three data points, plus the known value of the galaxies' redshifts, were being used to attempt to fit upwards of five terms. Indeed, as the
                                    effort matured, six terms were reduced to four.

                                <p style="text-align: left;">Results for neither galaxy were ideal, though at least for NGC 4395 the results do suggest that the effort did bring me closer to being able to meaningfully analyze galaxies using
                                    photometric data. Though wide in error range, my calculated magnitudes did agree with literature values and Prospector was able to tease FSPS towards converging on a particular, most
                                    probable model. Below you can see the particulars of these findings.

                                <p style="text-align: right;">Magnitude and emcee regression results for NGC 4395</p>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">Emcee featured 512 separate simulations, which were all calculated separately. Though a higher number could well have been
                                    chosen for, diminishing returns and calculation time conspired for this to not be a route that was taken, with each frame requiring between
                                    38 minutes and an hour and a half to calculate. Once calculated, a histogram was taken and formed into a corner plot 
                                    shown below together with the operations' best fitted SED model. For the former, the top of each column features a mean value, representing a most likely quantity
                                    for a given parameter based on the individual magnitudes and their ratios. The units for the y axis of the latter are in maggies, found by dividing the flux received by
                                    the flux of a zero AB magnitude object within the same filter.

                                <p style="text-align: left;">While no value for NGC 4395 matches literature values within even a 25% margin aside from mass, which is in solar mass units, they do all agree in being in the appropriate
                                    range with respect to comparisons made to the Milky Way and NGC 2976. Exactly what to make of this isn't clear at this time, though I believe it's primarily a product of 
                                    attempting to make conclusions that are very sensitive to small perturbations based on a very small data set. With more data, I would expect these to improve and converge
                                    with literature values, though another factor may be the limitations of using this software on unusual galaxies such as a low surface brightness Seyfert without a bulge and 
                                    numerous bright HII regions visible in the H-alpha data I acquired, but have yet to be able to feed into these models.

                                <p style="text-align: right;">Magnitudes and emcee regression for NGC 2976.</p>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">While NGC 4395 was something that could inspire a measure of hope for the method, though not the most spectacular result, NGC 2976 was somewhat less
                                    inspiriong. The values for magnitude were again found to be in agreement, though quite rough, but every suggested value for the parameters examined in 
                                    NGC 4395 was strongly bimodal. Initially this was thought to possibly be due to starburst activity, evidenced by a bright bar-like structure visible in the H-alpha filter
                                    of the galaxy, producing two distinct stellar populations. Upon reflection, however, it was concluded that this wasn't a quality the model should have been able to detect given that
                                    the entire galaxy was being treated as a single pixel. Further, the final SED that was synthesized was poorly fit in the blue, which despite the oddly young age the model claims on order of
                                    seven billion years, was lower than observations. Exactly why this might be the case is presently beyond me, though it's suspected that this lack of blue fitting and the strange values produced by
                                    of the model are interrelated.

                                    <p style="text-align: left;">Overall this project was a success, insofar as it was an opportunity taken to expand a knowledgebase and set of skills that will continue to prove useful in the future. 
                                    It was not a success in producing accurate models of these galaxies, but now freed from time constraints and a desire to treat both NGC 2976 and 4395 the same for the 
                                    sake of the project, numerous data sources are now available to feed into these software packages to continue tuning and expanding upon the gains that were made. Of particular
                                    interest is exploring the numerous HII regions in NGC 4395, remarkably active despite the general disposition of dwarves to be gas poor and composed of old stellar populations. Additionally,
                                    it may be possible to compare these results with other approximation methods such as the Kennicutt-Schmidt law. My
