                                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    There exist many paths to get to multivariate analysis and elements of it have been touched on in other sections of these notes. Still, there 
                                    exists enough material therein to devote at least some space to the peculiarities of multivariate data on its own. Consider that datasets that 
                                    appear to be only monovariate or bivariate may well be multivariate, whether due to there being significance to the sequence of data points or                                      or bivariate measurements 
                                    because separate measurement sequences can be combined to provide a multivariate window into the underlying phenomena. That aside, also consider 
                                    that many problems are themselves inherently multivariate and thus require treatment as such. 
                                </p>
                                <h4>Peculiarities of multivariate data</h4>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    While it may be tempting (and at times appropriate or at least expedient) to simply treat multivariate data as a collection of monovariate data sequences when 
                                    evaluating values such as means, distances, and distributions it is not necessarily the case. Various methods exist for distance, such as euclidean 
                                    distance, minkowski metrics, manhattan distance, and various forms of matrices such as proximity, distance, and dissimilation matrix. It can be important 
                                    to be certain of units for each of the variables when doing this, thinking how a dataset consisting of intensity and spatial location can grant much 
                                    larger distances if one measures distance in centimeters rather than parsecs. Dealing with distributions in multivariate space can similarly be problematic, 
                                    with units being a recurring issue and datatypes at times featuring distinct distributions. Some extant methods exist to deal with this such as 
                                    multivariate normal distibutions and Wishart distribution, but it's best to remain cogniscent of what the data actually is when attempting to extract this 
                                    type of data. 
                                </p>
                                <h4>PCA and ICA</h4>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    Once one has a sufficient understanding of the distance involved in a dataset, it can pay to simplify it as much as possible while retaining as much information 
                                    as possible. While there's generally no way to retain the entirety of information when one starts discarding elements of a set, it is not unusual to find that 
                                    most of the variance and thus the predicting, clustering, and resolving power of a dataset to primarily be driven by a subset of all measurement axes. This is 
                                    firstly the place of PCA or Pinciple Component Analysis, which (though actually a fairly fascinating linear algebra, like ICA) can be thought of as redrawing our 
                                    axes to maximize spread along them. This leads to a situation where our new axes are now combinations of our original ones, which might yield problems if we're 
                                    required to draw physical meaning from them in some cases, but in others may actually be the entire goal or simply be irrelevant if all we're aiming to do is 
                                    examine clustering. If we instead have measurements that are instead the product of different admixtures of <i>independent</i> phenomena, such as sound files that all 
                                    hear the same scene with different levels of various "noise" or the brightness profiles of galaxies, we can use independent Component Analysis, which again uses 
                                    some excellent linear algebra to find what those independent components are. The fundemental differences between these two, despite the similarity in their name, is 
                                    that PCA primarily searches for axes of maximal distance and typically returns new mixed axes from our original dataspace and allow us to truncate our data set if 
                                    the differences we want to observe are sufficiently governed by only a few of these axes (scree plots can help determine this) while ICA is most useful for decomposing 
                                    a dataset that is a function of multiple independent elements into those elements.
                                </p>
