                                <h3>General probability</h3>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    For many systems, it's difficult or impossible to predict the full suite of behaviors it may put out. This can be because of the system being
                                    fundementally non-analytic, simply too complicated and affected by too many factors to reasonably model, or because they obey some (at least
                                    perceived) true randomness. For these systems, it's often useful to resort to an understanding that describes outcomes in their likelihood or 
                                    <i>probability</i>. Examples of these are numerous in astronomy, whether it be in the distribution of photons on a CCD, the characteristics of
                                    stars (position, motion, metallicity, age, etc.), or the properties of other objects and classes of astronomical objects. 
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    As a general rule, the sum of all probabilities for a system, whether arising from a discrete or continuous basis, must sum to one (the continuous
                                    basis requiring integration). That is, the
                                    system must exhibit <i>some</i> behavior. A convenient way to think of this is how when a dice is rolled, barring situations where rules invalidate
                                    a roll, it must yield the value on one of its faces or another. Alternatively, a continuous example might be that of the position of a particle in
                                    a simple harmonic oscillator. The particle must be somewhere, even if certain positions are more likely than others.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Independence of results</h4>
								<p style="text-align: left;">
                                    One thing that can either be highly intuitive or deeply cryptic depending on one's disposition is that most statistical methods assume that the
                                    outcome for multiple evaluations of a phenomena (e.g. rolls of the dice) are independent of each other. While there are many interesting results of
                                    this property, among the most important is to understand that for truly random processes the odds never become "hot". When one rolls a <i>fair</i>
                                    six-sided die, the odds of getting a six are always 1/6. A related phenomena is that your odds of rolling a six do not double if you roll two die.
                                    Instead, it's a bit better than a quarter, instead of one third (see: binomial distributions for details). This is also why one's chances of winning
                                    the lottery don't scale linearly as one buys more tickets.
								</p>
                                <h4>Frequentist approach</h4>
								<p style="text-align: left;">
                                    This edges near the general thinking of the Frequentist approach. Though there exists a longstanding debate as to if it or the Bayesian approach is
                                    more appropriate and there may well be a case for it depending on the sort of question or system one is attempting to understand, the Frequentist take
                                    is often best described as the "classic" perspective on statistics despite Bayesian statistics themselves not at all being new (c.1763). To the
                                    frequentist, flipping a fair coin a sufficiently large number of times will tend all results towards being more or less evenly balanced. That is, you'll
                                    end up with about as many heads as tails, with the even-ness of the outcome set getting better as you flip the coin more times. This generally assumes
                                    that the probability distribution of a system is well defined and, if it changes over the course of experiments, changes in predictable ways. One concern
                                    with this is that if we know additional information about a system that might nudge the distribution of expected outcomes, the most rigid of Frequentist
                                    approaches would ignore this in favor of standing by the codified probability distribution. 
								</p>
                                <h4>Bayesian approach</h4>
								<p style="text-align: left;">
                                    As a counter to this, Bayesian statistics relies on the principle that we often do have at least some level of knowledge about the expected outcome of a
                                    probabilitistic phenomena, especially when we're repeating many experiments and feel it may be useful to "update" our probability distribution run-to-run.
                                    This takes the form of the probability of outcome A, given some known outcome B, is the probability of B given A, multiplied by the initial probability of A,
                                    finally divided by the probability of having gotten B. While convoluted and the many phenomena that can spring from this warrant their own exploration, it can
                                    be easier to think of this as the convolution of an old probability distribution and a new one that will skew the distribution in various ways depending on the
                                    individual probability distributions. One example of this that I've been given is to think in terms of updating odds after a sports game. While the team remains
                                    the same (give or take), we can use the results of each performance to skew what we model as the probability of winning the next game instead of relying on
                                    whatever model we developed at the beginning of a trial or season.
