                                    Having started back at my undergraduate studies back in Spring of 2020 (promptly complicated by Covid and more), my time as an undergrad 
                                    is quickly coming to an end. While details are sparse at this time, this page should serve to keep people updated on planning for the day of 
                                    graduation and any other activities as they follow. 
                                </p>
                                <h3>Pre-emptively answering some questions:</h3>
                                <dl style="text-align: left;">
                                    <dt><h4>When is it?</h4></dt>
                                    <dd class="indent">    
                                        Exactly what will be done and across which days it can be done will come down to a question of time (I expect to be tired), 
                                        money (I am what we in the industry call "poor"), and the timing of events like commencement that are beyond my control. At the moment, 
                                        it appears that commencement will take place <i>Saturday evening, 10 May, 2025</i>. At the moment, I expect to be busy much of the morning 
                                        due to graduation-related errands. Similarly, while I expect commencement itself to run until a reasonable time, I presently have no strong 
                                        plans for events to immediately follow. The next day would likely be best for any sort of larger activities or celebrations, with details to 
                                        eventually be posted here. I understand this might be inconvenient for some who are coming in from out of town, but was thought of in part 
                                        due to those coming in from several states away for whom it would be rude to attempt to condense the entirety of events into one day. I will 
                                        not be offended if attendees are only able to be there for one event or the other and people are welcome to reach out to me if they have 
                                        limited availability and want to be able to do something to take advantage of that, though I can't guarantee my own availability will be unlimited.

                                        Per the above, many of the details are undetermined as of now. Commencement itself will take place at Rice Stadium in Houston, Texas, however; weather 
                                        permitting.

                                        While things change all the time, I presently expect to receive a double BS in astrophysics and biophysics. It's possible, though not entirely 
                                        likely, that I'll receive a minor as well; the most probable of the improbable bunch being religion. For a detailed breakdown of what all I've been

                                        Ideally, sleep. Afterwards, I will likely be shifting my attention to relocating my life, as the graduate schools I'm applying to are 
                                        located outside of Houston. While the list of schools I'm considering isn't something I'll make public at this time, they are something I might 
                                        communicate privately. Ideally, by Fall of 2025 I will be relocated and beginning doctoral studies in either astrophysics, biophysics, or some applied 
                                        variation thereof (engineering, applied physics, etc.).

                                        There have existed a lot of ideas for what graduation would look like and while I might like to do in the time surrounding it. While these aren't 
                                        cancelled, I don't want to go into them until everything can be properly planned and commited, rather than get everyone's hopes up.

                                        I am terrible at giving gifts and thus expect none. I also tend to live such that there's not a lot that I need or want in my day to day. If you're 
                                        committed to the idea of sending a graduation or any other sort of gift, consider contributing some sort of party supply, transportation help, or funding.

                                        I am still in the process of drafting a list to mail formal invitations to. If you want one, please reach out with an address so I know where to send things.

                                        will do what I can to help people myself. While I can't volunteer much in terms of sleeping space, I do have limited room available as well.
