                                <h3>The concept behind nonparametric statistics</h3>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    When doing statistics, one generally starts with a number of assumptions about the underlying distribution. Particularly, we like to do statistics
                                    when we can say we understand what the underlying distribution is. Personally, I would wish all phenomena to obey Poisson distribution (see:
                                    the many nice properties therein) but such is not the case. Instead, it's not unusual to be confronted with a system where we either don't know
                                    the properties of the distribution, know it to not follow a parametric family, or simply want results that don't care about the parametric properties.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    Among the most robust (that is, least liable to fall apart due to outliers, erroneous data) methods of dealing with nonparametric data is via the
                                    family of rank tests. Relying on the concepts in emperical distributions, these generally compare the distribution between two data sets or a data set
                                    and a synthetic or theoretical distribution. Important examples include the Spearman's rank test, KS test, and Wilcoxan rank sum test. 
                                    There exists a second Spearman test (rho rank) that can help with multivariate data. Other relatively 
                                    robust tests for comparing populations nonparametrically include the CvM statistic, the sign test, and contingency tables, with the latter being
                                    particularly helpful when one has multiple sets of categorical data and wants to know the odds of particular categories being correlated or not. 
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    A noteworthy element is that nonparametrics are most often used for comparing populations, though for non-categorical data on populations there are
                                    additional considerations. Particularly, it can be very difficult to measure the mean of a distribution, requiring that we resort things like resort
                                    to using the median for arguments in various considerations. Another common approach in nonparametrics is the concept of the trimmed mean (trimean) 
                                    where we assume that some elements at the extremes of our distribution are best discarded, though the exact reasoning behind chopping off datapoints 
                                    from the top, bottom, or both ends of the distribution and to what degree is somewhat ill-defined.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    A final method that fits best here even if it has far wider applications than simply handling nonparametric data is the concept of bootstrapping. Here, 
                                    we operate under the principle that even if we have a sequence of data that reads (1, -2, 5, 3, 0) we cannot assume that, say, -1 can or should appear in 
                                    it. Instead, we can attempt to model the behavior of the distribution by creating a subset of the data where we grab random values from out data set either 
                                    allowing ourselves to grab the same value from it more than once (termed "with replacement") or not ("without replacement"). We can then sample this many times 
                                    to get a sense of what possible distrbutions of our outcome would be under the principle that any of the synthetic "boostrap" datasets are potential outcomes 
                                    to our observation. As mentioned, this concept and those very similar to it appear many times across the field of statistics and various methods, a noteable 
                                    example being "bagging" as appears in some methods used to treat multivariate data.
