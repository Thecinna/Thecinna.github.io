                                <h3>Stationarity and isotropy</h3>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    While there are many problems that can be approached as spatial point processes, the way of dealing with these tends to differ little from how 
                                    one would deal with clustering, multivariate data, or time series analysis (adapted to spatial rather than temporal units). Potentially central, 
                                    however, are the concepts of stationarity and isotropy, which can become the prime problems when attempting to apply the general techniques 
                                    utilized in spatial analysis due to their often being assumed. Stationarity is the notion that the data is invariant under translation, which, 
                                    at first glance, seems to mean that we must have homogenous data that's the same everywhere, but isn't necessarily the case. Instead, we're mostly 
                                    concerned that a datapoint's value isn't dependented on a particular origin and is in general independent of its coordinate location. This goes 
                                    hand in hand with isotropy, which is the same concept, but applied to rotations and the desired trait that the data doesn't vary in a distinct way 
                                    if one moves away from a point in one direction versus another. 
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    There certainly do exist various techniques for determining if data is both stationary and isotropic, but the simplest is simply looking at the data. In 
                                    general, stationary and isotropic data will lack structure aside from globular, rounded features. Particularly suspicious would be anything resembling 
                                    a slope in the data from one edge to the other, evenly spaced periodic phenomena, or extended lines or bars. One might do some sort of density kernel 
                                    to approximate the general "shape" of data, simply plot it in some 3D (or higher space) way, or finally, if one really needs to produce a statistically 
                                    rigorous value, the nearest-neighbor distribution can be calculated and compared with complete spatial randomness, with the ideal data being spatially 
                                    random.
                                </p>
                                <h3>The variogram</h3>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    Though almost covered as a subtopic of kriging, the variogram or semivariogram (there are many varieties) provides a wealth of information about how 
                                    data behaves, with the only reason that it isn't in the above section for detecting nonstationarity or anisotropy being that it doesn't provide a 
                                    method of differentiating the two, though it can be used to detect if either exist. Plotting different forms of the variance between points for 
                                    increasing distance, weighting, and distance depending on the form, the classic semivariogram and its features as the cornerstone of kriging methods. 
                                    In particular, a good dataset for kriging will feature a semivariogram with a well-defined y intercept (termed a nugget) that characterizes the minimum 
                                    variance between points and implies randomness (thus nonstationarity, anisotropy) in the data. Similarly, the semivariogram should lead up to a consistent 
                                    height in y, implying sufficiently distant points tell us no more or less than yet further points, again reinforcing the randomness argument. This y value 
                                    is termed the "sill" and the distance in x, itself a measure of spatial distance, is the range.  These all by themselves already can inform us a great 
                                    deal about what the properties of the data are and may be enough to answer our questions if we don't actively need an interpolated map of the data. 
                                </p>
                                
                                <h3>Kriging and interpolation</h3>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    Again, there exist a variety of topics in spatial point processes, many of which have to do with clustering and correlation, but interpolation and the 
                                    (originally) geostatistical technique known as kriging are particular to spatial processes and deserve their own aside. For any dataset in space, there 
                                    is likely a case to be made for the idea that more information would be useful so that we can better understand what's going on between the points that 
                                    are measured. This could in turn quickly become an exercise in futility as we endeavor just to get that extra little bit of information that we need to 
                                    confidently assert whatever it is that we're after, rather than accepting that the points we have can inform us what's going on between them with a 
                                    reasonable degree of uncertainty. If we know the data fits a particular distribution (that we either know beforehand or attain via regression) then we 
                                    can simply use that, though be mindful of the blackbox nature of regression. Alternatively, if we know the data is spatially random per the techniques 
                                    outlined above (particularly the semivariogram), it's possible to use the kriging method to rigorously interpolate between datapoints via correlation 
                                    weightings of the datapoints that nicely handles things like uneven distribution of sample locations. Because of its usefulness and the many issues 
                                    that may arise in sample location distribution, stationarity, isotropy, multivariate fitting, and so on, numerous forms of this exist to suit various 
                                    needs. Be sure to look for a particular form that answers the particular question you're after. As a useful appendix, check:
                                    <li>Simple kriging: Must know mean beforehand</li>
                                    <li>Ordinary kriging: Data must be stationary, anisotropic</li>

                                    <li>Universal kriging: Handles a lot of the cleaning of data first, maps to residuals</li>
                                    <li>Nonlinear kriging: Can handle variation that's nonlinear in coordinate space</li>
                                    <li>Multitype kriging: Can handle variations that are categorical as well as numerical</li>
                                    <li>Multivariate kriging: Does exactly what it sounds like</li>
                                </p>
                                <h3>Tessellations</h3>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    While the minimum spanning tree may be more akin to previous work in clustering, it can give a sense of how data may be distributed relative to certain 
                                    seed points of interest. Potentially more useful, however, are regions that are closest to the seed points, which go by a variety of names including 
                                    Dirichlet, Voronoi, and Thiessen tessellations. While they can be produced via minimum spanning tree, I've found the buffer method most useful, wherein 
                                    an annulus is measured from each point and the radii at which the annuli intersect become the edges of each region, as this tends to avoid nondeterministic 
                                    results. While there are applications for this, particularly in clustering, an interesting historical application was the discovery that cholera was a 
                                    waterborne disease when it was found that infections in London mapped to regions defined by their nearest watermain.
