                                <h3>Motivation behind smoothing and density estimation</h3>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    Put simply, we often just don't have time to perform the inordinate number of measurements required to get a "smooth" distribution if we
                                    were to plot all of our measurements on some convenient set of axes. Exactly how to handle this can become quite involved, however, and 
                                    requires steps that may not be well defined by statistics (that is, we might just have to feel out some things). As always, it's important to 
                                    start from a position of asking what the actual goal is and if we're willing to accept a result prior to knowing what it may be. For multivariate 
                                    data sets, some of these methods have reasonable extensions while checking out kriging under spatial point processes may also prove worthwhile.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Histograms</h4>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    While far from ideal, a histogram of data values can be an excellent place to start with any statistical analysis, even if it's not something 
                                    that's intended for one's final product. Additionally, if one does want to attempt to use a histogram for some sort of statistical analysis 
                                    (often not adviseable, but sometimes necessary or expedient) one would do well to simply "guess" a variety of bin widths for the histogram. While 
                                    one might want to rely on statistically derived methods of choosing bin width in order to claim some sort of impartiality, there simply isn't much 
                                    basis for statistical rigor in this field, though that doesn't mean nothing exists one might use. Namely Scott's bin width and Silverman's Rule of
                                    Thumb bin width. 
                                </p>
                                <h4>Kernel density estimators</h4>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    While histograms generally aren't good statistical tools (though they can be good for first order visualization), kernel density estimators can 
                                    fill some of the void left for a more rigorous method of visualizing the distribution of data and smoothing over outliers. For R specifically, IQR() 
                                    and density() are useful tools here, while the Epanechnikov kernel has served as a favorite "static" kernal in prior work due to it introducing fewer 
                                    artifacts. While a variety of other non-adaptive kernels exist, adaptive kernels are their own useful field and tend to rely on local bandwith or 
                                    nearest neighbor approaches. 
                                </p>
                                <h4>Nonparametrics</h4>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    While covered elsewhere in this guide, there is room here for a group of nonparametric smoothing methods that operate by searching for a function that 
                                    minimizes some error (generally per some chi-square, least squares, etc.) when fitted to the data. Of these, the most noteworthy examples I've seen 
                                    are the Nadaraya-Watson estimator, which I've gotten good results from, and various spline methods. While splines remain popular in a variety of fields 
                                    and applications, I've personally found them somewhat prone to the same issues as histograms in that choosing a spline number becomes something of an 
                                    arbitrary exercise where over-fitting data becomes increasingly likely and gets worse with more ill-behaved data. There do exist some methods for more 
                                    rigorous application of splines and I've seen mention of a LOWESS method of fitting kernels, but overall I would recommend sticking to known kernels with 
                                    known properties or the Nadaraya-Watson estimator.
