                                <h3>Periodicity is the name of the game</h3>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    While focused on time series analysis, keep in mind that most of what's covered here could easily be applied to other forms of periodic 
                                    data so long as we're looking at a periodic behavior in one variable in relation to another. Addressing periods that change in time presents 
                                    its own separate issue as well. Finally, keep in mind that while methods for deriving the period observed in evenly spaced data points is well 
                                    established via work on a variety of fronts, discerning periodicity in aperiodic observations is difficult and ultimately there's a need to 
                                    observe for at least one full period to stand any real chance of getting a good fit.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    This isn't to say that periodicity is the only thing that's worth looking into when doing time series analysis or attempting to understand how 
                                    the phenomena data maps to changes in time. Simply, one of the quirks that's most particular to time series data, especially in astronomy, is 
                                    finding periodic behavior. Note that, unlike in other fields of observational science, astronomy also has trouble with getting consistent, evenly 
                                    spaced data when attempting to find periodicity, rendering a lot of the classic techniques in the field less useful.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Evenly spaced data</h3>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    While one could simply take a sine or cosine and attempt to fit it to their data (indeed, for some data this may be sufficient) the more general 
                                    idea is to find <i>autocorrelation</i> in the data. That is, points in the data that inform on other points in the data downstream of them. A 
                                    handy way to begin considering this is to think of how one would answer a question as to the price of milk. If one knew it was a particular price 
                                    yesterday, they'd consider that fairly helpful, but then if they knew of weekly, monthly, or annual trends as well (milk is always more expensive 
                                    on Tuesdays, even more so the second Tuesday of each month, and finally always the worst in March) then one would take that into account when 
                                    answering. One would then consider developing a function that predicted the price of milk (or whatever) based on the sequence of prior data, all 
                                    weighted in different ways. One could also consider limits of uncertainty in this approach, often driven by time, that would mean that many of 
                                    the weights could be set to zero given that their contribution can't be certain above the level of random fluctuation. This gets into the concept 
                                    of ACF and PACF functions, with the two differing primarily by the diminishing weighting of older data for PACF.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    Given that so much science is done under this field of phenomena, however, there exist many, many ways of dealing with this that have to do with 
                                    different ways of smoothing over issues in periods or aperiodicity in the periods, provided the data remains evenly spaced. ARIMA for instance 
                                    can be useful for noisy periods due to how it averages out a lot of the issues. Wavelets and fourier transforms represent another method of 
                                    analyzing these sorts of behavior via frequency-space representations, with applications well beyond simply hunting for a period. Periodograms 
                                    represent another excellent tool that can tell us about complicated periodic behavior and even have forms that can be applied to unevenly spaced 
                                    data.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Unevenly spaced measurement</h3>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    In an ideal world, one would always arrange for proper windows and sampling frequency such that one could simply fit a sine wave to the data and 
                                    be done with it. The problems are, oftentimes the data contains a combination of periodic behavior that might make any such sine wave non-obvious 
                                    both to the eye and one's algorithm of choice or one can't always get a constant, consistent observation window whether it's due to instrument 
                                    availability, weather, object availability, or other miscellaneous factors. The latter end up relying on the techniques for unevenly spaced data 
                                    analysis, which, though less refined than the techniques for evenly spaced data, do remain a strong set of tools with at times remarkable abilities.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    If the data is sufficiently well behaved (the period is well defined and isn't hidden under several other periods) then the fairly simple 
                                    minimum string-length statistic is quite useful. Operating on the principle that the shortest length of string that could connect all points 
                                    is the one that follows the same period as the data, one can fairly quickly use standard regression techniques to hone in on a decent result. 
                                    Alternatively, the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, though rarely quite as aesthetically clean as its more classical cousins, is highly effective in picking 
                                    out periodic behaviors in most data sets so long as the measurements are reasonably distributed across periods. I have had issues with this picking 
                                    out multiple periods in data with only one period, however, and similarly picking up only one period in data that's constructed of two periods. 
                                    The exact reasons why are somewhat opaque and likely vary case to case, but expect it to behave best for well distributed data with many points to 
                                    use for regressive analysis.
                                </p>
