                                <h3>Tools for the job</h3>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    While, as always, one must defer to certain constraints of the client when choosing development environments and there's always something nice
                                    about high level programming suites, I've genuinely found <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/categories/rstudio-ide/">Rstudio</a> to be the most
                                    intuitive and convenient means of messing with R at a fairly low level. In particular, I enjoy the ease with which one can arrange tasks in notebooks,
                                    the built in knit to pdf ability, and convenient management of libaries. Despite what might appear to be a student-oriented interface, 
                                    there's no reason one can't use it for more advanced applications if one wanted to.
                                </p>
								<h3>General syntax</h3>
                                <h4>Assigning variables</h4>
								<p style="text-align: left;">
                                    For better or worse, R follows the general conventions seen in Python or Matlab. Despite what many pages would have you believe, there's no need
                                    to asign your objects using an arrow, written as "<-". Instead, it's perfectly acceptable to use the "=" you've become accustomed to. While some 
                                    issues may eventually appear, current experience is such that the distinction is irrelevant.
								</p>
                                <h4>Libraries, packages</h4>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    Like most programming languages, R has a large body of community built and maintained libraries that can handle most of the more complicated tasks
                                    one might be concerned with. This can either be a help or a hindrance, if one allows themself to become lazy in their programming or simply accepts an
                                    output without critically considering what it is a particular library does.
                                    Libraries can be installed using 
                                    <li>install.libraries("name")</li>
                                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                                        While libaries can be imported into a particular R program using
                                    </p>
                                    <li>library(name)</li>
                                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                                        Given that there are many libaries that serve many purposes, <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org">Rdocumentation</a> is generally the place to look when
                                        trying to figure out how to use a particular library. As a forewarning (or postwarning, more likely), the built in search function is seemingly tempermental.
                                        While some underlying behavior of how the queries are entered is likely at play, in order to navigate to the documentation for a particular command it can sometimes
                                        be easier to first search its library in browser with an appended call for rdocumentation.org results.
                                    </p>
                                </p>
                                <h4>Recommended general libraries</h4>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    While R does have a built in plot command, aptly named plot(), its functionality can at times be limited. The ggplot2 library is predictably the evolution of the older ggplot,
                                    a separate plotting library that handles a wide range of more refined plotting tasks. 
                                </p>
                                <h4>R specific quirks</h4>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    <li>
                                        R, unlike Python and Matlab, cannot have functions that return multiple objects. There are ways around this by way of having it return a sequence (list) that contains the objects
                                        you want, but such can often be a bit of a cludge.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        R does not require end-of-line characters to silence an output. In fact, it generally won't print any sort of output when exectured unless such is part of a libraries' execution
                                        or one enters an object's name on its own line. While this can be useful, it's often more refined and less cluttery in the output window to use the built in summary() command.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        One of the best uses of R is to use dataframes, defined using data.frame(object). This allows the use of datasets in a format akin to a complete csv file, with the ability to call
                                        indiviual columns or sets of columns via dataframe_object$column. One can also filter dataframes by assigning new_object = dataframe_object[filter criteria].
                                    </li>
                                </p>
